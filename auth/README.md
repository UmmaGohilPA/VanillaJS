# Log In and Out with Vanilla JS

Small project to understand cookies/localStorage/sessionStorage etc.

## Cookies

- Cookie is a simple key-value pair

- Web browser saves the cookie internally and sends to the server whenever the client wants to request to the server

- Header: information about request/response

- Response: data exchanged between client and server

- Cookie saved in HTTP header

## Session

- Session based auth, user info saved on server; client and server communicates via session id

- In real life use a third party lib like express-session or cookie-parser
